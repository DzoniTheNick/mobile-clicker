# Project description
This project is a small sever/client application that I made for one of my courses. 
The server side of the application listens for incoming signals from the mobile application (client)
and changes slides of the presentation (simulates left/right key) as requested.
The sever side of the application was build in Java and the Client side was build in
Android Studios (also Java)
